# Datamosher Pro
<b> Datamosher Pro is an automatic, algorithm based video-glitching application for free! (python) 
<br><img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89206401/141642297-7c62cf6f-7024-430f-88a2-c9cbbf0dc655.png" width="300">

<br> It contains over `30+` different effects/algorithms/scripts that can emulate any style of datamoshing.
<br> There are two versions available: a premium paid version for Windows and a basic free version with source code. 
<br> If you‚Äôre aiming to easily create datamosh effects in your videos, you‚Äôre in the right spot!

### Story behind the Software
I was also searching for some good datamoshing software and I noticed that we either have to use those outdated programs like Avidemux or look for some paid plugins. 
Then I found some scripts and algorithms available for datamoshing which gives accurate results, but not everyone knows how to run those scripts on their system, hence I developed this GUI application for those scripts and added lots of new features which make this datamoshing process super easy. Just import the video and click the mosh button.

# Effects List
### Effects available in the python version:
**Main datamosh effects:**
| Effect Name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Void            | gives the standard datamosh cuts based on video vectors (automatic i-frame removal) |
| Classic         | gives the avidemux type datamosh within a range |
| Classic2        | similar to classic mode, but more precise results (uses frame numbers) |
| Combine         | combine multiple videos and mosh them together |
| Rise            | gives you the ffglitch datamosh by manually removing a range of i frames |
| Shuffle         | randomly shuffles chunks of frames and then moshes them with the normal ffglitch datamosh |
| Sort            | sorts video frames by data size and merges them with the classic datamosh |
| Motion Transfer | transfer the vector motion data from one video to another |

**Frame Repeatation datamosh:**
| Effect Name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bloom           | duplicates a key-frame multiple times with void mode |
| Water Bloom     | duplicates any frame multiple times with ffglitch (more precise than bloom) |
| Repeat          | repeats a **series** of frames multiple times |
| Glide           | duplicates macroblocks multiple times in a continuos order |
| Pulse           | duplicates groups of some p-frames every n times (heavy to render) |

Other glitch/datamosh modes
| Effect Name     | Description                                                           |

| Zoom            | simply zooms inside the moshed video |
| Fluid           | ffglitch's average motion effect which gives a smooth liquid type effect |
| Stretch         | stretches the macroblock of video both horizontally and vertically |
| Echo            | duplicates the single video and apply the mosh effect in the midpoint

## Note from Author
It took lots of effort and time while developing this app, hope this program can be your companion while editing cool glitchy videos :)
<br> As it is a new piece of software some users may find bugs, but updates will be on their way. (You can report them through the issues tab)
<br> The effects are inspired from the [tomato.py](https://github.com/itsKaspar/tomato) script, [pymosh](https://github.com/grampajoe/pymosh) and [FFglitch](https://ffglitch.org/). 
All the logos and ui designs are created by me.
