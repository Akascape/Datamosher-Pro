#Datamosher Pro
<br>So, datamoshing is a effect that really look cool and you also want to make this glitch effect with your videos, so you are in the right place.
<br>➤Why I made this?
<br>I was also looking for good datamoshing softwares, you can either have to use those old softwares like Avidemux or have to look for some paid plugins, but I created my own GUI based application that is Datamosher Pro which is a free and opensource project. It contains 7 effects for now and more will be added in future, you can also help me to make new effects.
<br>➤How to Install?
<br>You can either use the python based version for viewing logs and changing some settings if you want, but if you are looking for faster renders then download the executable version of Datamosher Pro. There is no malware in the exe version as the same python version is converted to .exe using Auto-Py-To-Exe Converter.
<br>Note: For python users, make sure you have all the assets with the python file and Imageio module installed in your system (if not then open CMD and type"pip install imageio" and it will be installed).
<br>➤How to Use?
<br>➤Open the video file first(supported formats-mp4,gif,avi + more will be added if you demand")
<br>➤Choose the desired datamosh mode, then select the export format."
<br>➤Use advance options to get more accurate results"
<br>➤Then just click on the datamosh button, then wait for a few seconds."
<br>➤Then your video will be moshed, see the video in the directory."
<br>➤Note that if you mosh the same files in the same location again, then the new moshed file will replace the old file.

<br>The utilities are all inspired from ItsKasper's tomato.py. But it can only handle .avi file structure
