# Datamosher Pro
<b> Datamosher Pro is an automatic video-glitching application for free! (python version) <br>
<br><img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89206401/141642297-7c62cf6f-7024-430f-88a2-c9cbbf0dc655.png" width="300">
### Why I made this?
I was also searching for some good datamoshing software and I found that you have to either use those old softwares like Avidemux or have to look for some paid plugins, so I created my own python based application 'Datamosher Pro'. If you want to achieve datamosh effects in your videos easily, then you are in the right place!

It contains `30+` different effects which can replicate any type of datamoshing style.
It comes in two version, one paid windows version and one basic free source-code version.

| Zoom            | simply zooms inside the moshed video |
| Fluid           | ffglitch's average motion effect which gives a smooth liquid type effect |
| Stretch         | stretches the macroblock of video both horizontally and vertically |
| Echo            | duplicates the single video and apply the mosh effect in the midpoint

## Conclusion
You will not find this type of software anywhere with so many effects only for datamoshing. This program can be your companion while editing cool glitchy videos :)
<br> As it is a new piece of software some users may find small bugs, but updates will be on their way.
<br> The effects are all inspired from ItsKaspar's [tomato.py](https://github.com/itsKaspar/tomato) script, [pymosh](https://github.com/grampajoe/pymosh) and [FFglitch](https://ffglitch.org/). 
All the logos and ui designs are created by me.
