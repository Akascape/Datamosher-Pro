# Datamosher Pro

<br> Datamosher Pro is an automatic glitching application for free (python version)! <br>
### Why I made this?
I was also searching for some good datamoshing software and I found that you have to either use those old softwares like Avidemux or have to look for some paid plugins, so I created my own python based application 'Datamosher Pro'. It contains `30+` different effects which can replicate any type of datamoshing style.
It comes in two version, one paid windows version and one basic free source code version.

| Shuffle         | randomly shuffles chunks of video frames with the classic ffglitch datamosh|
| Buffer          | creates ring buffers to mosh|
| Delay           | delaying mosh effect|
| Invert-Reverse  | applies both inverse and reverse mode randomly|
| Mirror          | does the mosh with mirrored X|
| Noise           | makes large noisy mosh|
| Shear           | tilt and mosh the video clockwise |

| Zoom            | simply zooms inside the moshed video|
| Fluid           | this is a ffglitch's average effect which gives a smooth liquid type motion in the video|
| Repeat          | repeats a series of p frames which gives the melting effect|

| Echo            | duplicates the single video and apply the mosh effect in the midpoint|
| Classic         | uses the traditional ffmpeg way to convert and corrupt the video by removing the i-frames|

| Reverse         | reverses frame order|
| Invert          | switches each consecutive frame witch each other|

| Pulse           | duplicates groups of c p-frames every n frames|
| Overlap         | copy group of c frames taken from every nth position|
| Jiggle          | take frame from around current position. n parameter is spread size|

## Conclusion
You will not find this type of software anywhere with so many effects only for datamoshing. This program can be your companion while editing cool glitchy videos :)
<br> As it is a new piece of software some users may find some bugs, but updates will be on their way.
<br> The effects are all inspired from ItsKaspar's [tomato.py](https://github.com/itsKaspar/tomato), Joe Friedl's [pymosh](https://github.com/grampajoe/pymosh) and [FFglitch](https://ffglitch.org/).
