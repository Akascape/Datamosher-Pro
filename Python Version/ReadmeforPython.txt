#Read this to use the python version.
This version is comparitively lower in size and works the same inside python environment. To use this version, just download the zip file and extract this folder and then double click on the Datamosher Pro v1.1.py to open the program, then use the software as describes in the Readme.md or click the "i" button inside the software.
Note that you must have the required modules installed. Most of the modules that are used are installed by default, but only one module you need to install separately is Imageio.
To install that module, open CMD or other terminal and type "pip install Imageio" and "pip install Imageio-ffmpeg, then it will be installed and you can open Datamosher Pro v1.1.py. Also change the directory of ffmpeg if needed (see the comments)
Do not delete or move any assets that are linked with the main file or else it will show error.
So, this is all about the python version, you can now Datamosh your videos!
